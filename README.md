Common Android Classes
===

###Description

These are some common classes for Android development in usual work days.
I just thought I need a place to find them easier.

If your have any better opinions of one of them, or also want to mark one of
yours in here, please give me a pull-request.

If one day, some developers can find something useful here, I'll be proud of
what I'm done today.

###Usage

You will find a full javadoc in every class or a README in every package
folder. Just follow it.

###Rules

Any one class or package should have a README.md or full javadoc(for single
class), it should includes following things:

- available above which API level
- permission(s) it uses on Android platform (if exist)
